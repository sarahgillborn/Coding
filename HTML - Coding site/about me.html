<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sarah. I'm an a researcher and lecturer at a UK university.<br>
  I started learning to code properly in 2022 after reigniting the love I had for it in my teens. Here goes nothing!<br>
  Outside of coding, I like to play MMORPGs (mostly Final Fantasy XIV and a bit of World of Warcraft), drink beer, go to local gigs, and have a season ticket at Nottingham Forest Football Club.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this website is just to practice what I learn - so, sorry if you're seeing this!</p>

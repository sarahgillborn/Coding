<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Sarah. I have a PhD in psychology and I'm a researcher and lecturer at a UK university.<br>
  I enjoyed coding in my teens but lost any opportunities to do it. In 2022, I decided to get back into it by starting an online coding course.<br>
  Outside of coding, I like to play MMORPGs (mostly Final Fantasy XIV and a bit of World of Warcraft), drink beer, go to local gigs, and have a season ticket at Nottingham Forest Football Club.

<p>The purpose of this website is just to practice what I learn - so, sorry if you're seeing this!</p>
